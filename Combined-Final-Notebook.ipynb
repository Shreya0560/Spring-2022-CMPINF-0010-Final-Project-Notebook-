When tasked with determining the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh, our team came to the conclusion that the *best* neighborhood will ultimately be the **healthiest** neighborhood."

While environmental factors continue to have an increased role in determining the quality of necessities like air and water, our group leaned into other, non-environmental metrics for quantifying the health of Pittsburgh neighborhoods. The three metrics we decided to consider are **nutrition, access to medical care, and opportunity for recreation and fitness.** Orinigally, we considered focusing on just one of any of these three metrics and looked for datasets that fit under just one idea, but then realized our analysis would be far more compelling if we combined analysis under all *three* ideas into the overall metric of health."
